Test ng:

package testNG;
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class TestNgAnnotations {
//in testNG by default the methods gets executed in alphabetical order
	//but we can set the priorities
	@Test(priority=1, description="this test case will verify the login functionality")
	public void loginTest(){
		
		
	}
	@Test(priority=2,description="this test case will add items ot the basket")
	public void selectItems(){
		Assert.assertEquals(12, 13);//here expected is 13 but the actual is 12 so the test case fails and 
		//it will still continue executing the remaining test cases
		
	}
//testNG supports negative numbers as priorities.and the testcases or the methods with negative numbers as priorities 
	//will be executed first
	//testNG also has the flexibility that whenever a test case fails then it will continue executing the remaining 
	//part of the application or the remaining test cases
	@Test(priority=-3, description="this test case will perform check out operation")
	public void checkout(){
